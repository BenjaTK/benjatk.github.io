I wasn't sure if I wanted comments, and I'm still not entirely sure: I don't want this to turn into me seeking interaction like social media. But I also love getting to talk to people and it felt a bit lonely without it. So why not try it! 

I followed a [guide on a comments system](https://aristath.github.io/blog/static-site-comments-using-github-issues-api), which means I copy pasted everything, then started tweaking the CSS. I think I'm pretty happy with how they turned out, they look cute and fit the rest of the site. I can always tweak it more later (remember, always a WIP!).

_As of the 21st of August 2024, they look like this!_

It's pretty easy to comment, though you'll need a GitHub account: every post that has comments enabled will have a link below to an issue in the GitHub repo of the site where you can comment. Every comment will appear (almost) instantly on the site!

Additionally, I've changed the pixel font to a custom one I made a while back. It's a bit smaller than the last one, so I'm not sure if it's as readable, but the other one felt more like fake pixel art. This one is made with [BitFontMaker2](https://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/).
