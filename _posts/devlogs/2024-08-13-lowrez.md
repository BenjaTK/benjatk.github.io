excerpt: The LOWREZJAM is a game jam about making games in 64x64 pixels or less. This year I made a game for it.

The **LOWREZJAM** has always intrigued me. I already make tiny games (both in size and resolution), but I'd never made a game in a size _this_ small. How much could I cramp in such a tiny space? So this year I finally decided to participate.

The start was a bit rough. For the first few days, I couldn't find an idea I liked AND that could be feasible to make. The themes didn't help much either (though maybe this one was my fault).

_This idea could be funny for another game, though._

So after thinking I just wasn't going to participate, I decided to give a **last idea** a try. The vision I had in mind was one where you would be flying around stopping fires. I didn't have much else than that, so I started with the fires.

This felt fun and like it had potential, so I kept working on it. I decided some enemies to distract you and pressure you could make it a bit more challenging.

_While working on visual polish early on isn't that recommended, I find it helps keep me motivated._

This felt **SO fun**. Fun fact: that explosion animation was supposed to be a placeholder but I liked it so much I kept it. I was feeling confident this could turn out good, I was playing it instead of working on it, but that's a good sign, right?

When playing, I noticed the fire was kind of distracting. Like in an annoying way. And it felt easy to lose track of it. At first, I tried removing it, and that's what I thought I would do for a bit. I even added an enemy with a laser that could kill other enemies. But the next day, when playing, the game felt empty without the fire. The fire made it feel more unique, while without it I was on track to making another generic action game.

So I re-added it, did some balancing tweaks and made the previously enclosed arena infinite. I posted a gif on my Discord server ([join here](https://discord.gg/V7UsX54V49)) and then sirmilkman basically saved the game.

I decided to try it out, not super confident. And it changed the game entirely. Now both main mechanics, which previously felt disconnected, made a cohesive whole and a pretty fun game loop. Dodge enemies, let them kill each other, then clean up their mess. Firefighter's main mechanic was completed, and with still a lot of time left of the jam (at the time of writing this it hasn't even ended).

The next few days came with a lot of iteration (and I forgot to record most of it). 
- I first had a water tank, then removed it because it was too limiting.
- I added health, but then noticed having 2 lose conditions (too much fire and losing all HP) was terribly annoying; so now when you get hit, you make a big explosion of fire and get stunned for a second.
- I added a splash of water you could activate when your water tank was full, then later changed it so you could get "charges" of this ability with crates falling from the sky.

_The HUD was also really cluttered in this version which I didn't like_

After a few days (where I entered the zone a few times), I had the final product:

I actually added 2 more enemies after publishing it (fast small lil guys that spawn in groups and what's basically a Creeper), but ~~I don't feel like recording footage of them~~ I'll keep them a secret so you go play the game ;)

Speaking of which, you can go play it on my **itch.io**:

# Conclusion 

I'm actually really proud of this game. I don't know how it'll do in the jam, but I'm still really happy to add it to my roster. Hope you like it as much as I do!
