Hey! I'm **BenjaTK** (j pronounced like the _h_ in _here_). I make **tiny freeware videogames** and publish them on [itch.io](https://benjatk.itch.io/). I've also made some addons for Godot that you can find on my [GitHub](https://github.com/BenjaTK).

I've been doing this for about 4 years now, and it's been a blast (though not without its struggles). Here are some highlights:

## [Terraforma](https://benjatk.itch.io/terraforma)

Probably my favorite game of mine.

*In Terraforma you build a world out of tiles that generate points based on the other tiles around them.*

Made for the **Kenney Jam 2022**, I think the concept was pretty solid which is why I think it worked that well. It also made me realize that the market for idle games in itch.io is HUGE, most views I got were from the idle tag.

I even got contacted by 2 websites to publish the game, one of which didn't go through but the other one, [CrazyGames](https://www.crazygames.com/game/terraforma?bypassCache=o9ipl), did. This one not only got me a different public, but also gave me some of the funniest "feedback" I've received (including some insults in Russian).

## [Detective Paws](https://benjatk.itch.io/detective-paws) and [Lilypaw Games](https://lilypaw-games.itch.io/)

This one was made for the **Cozy Autumn Game Jam 2023**. It was my second time working on a team, with [**Kaboppel**](https://phil-o.itch.io/) and [**Kris**](https://dapper-kris.itch.io/). It's a short detective point-and-click adventure about figuring out the biggest mystery of all: where leaves go in autumn. 

I'm really really proud of this one. Not only is the cast of characters great, I also have never been super confident working on teams; except for this one. It was a great experience making it, so great it sparked a studio: [**Lilypaw Games**](https://lilypaw-games.itch.io/).

Though development in Lilypaw Games HQ has been slow, we have been working on a bunch of prototypes together, and can't wait to share them.

## [Gaea](https://github.com/BenjaTK/Gaea)

A procedural generation addon for Godot 4, including support for 2D and 3D, chunk loading, a lot of customization, and more.

I don't really remember why I made this. I was bored ig. But it skyrocketed into something much bigger than I would've expected. It got featured in YouTube videos, has almost 1k stars and has been constantly growing since I made it.
