Another month is up and I didn't write anything! ...
This month I just didn't feel that motivated to write on here, plus I've been very busy with some stuff and haven't done enough gamedev. Oh well.

# Gamedev

The witch game I started making in October is still on hold as I don't know how to continue it, and I don't know if it ever will release. November was not a very gamedev-y month for me, but I did do a few things.

## Bevy

I started learning Bevy (and therefore, Rust, at the same time). It's fun! I really like the ECS structure. I think I'll stick to Godot for the time being but it was a fun experiment to get me back on the gamedev grind.

## 64x64 game in 64 minutes

[Sirmilkman](sirmilkman.com) posted in Discord that they did a 16x16 game in 16 minutes, and they nominated everyone else to try it. Then [Hairic](https://hairic.itch.io/) did a 32x32 game in 32 minutes. So the next obvious step was to make a 64x64 game in 64 minutes:

It's ok. It's nothing special, just a TD game. I didn't quite get to finish how I wanted it, but still, it felt nice to get something going.

# Reading

Yeah... Much like gamedev, quite literally nothing to see here. I did start Discworld towards the end of the month (Color of Magic), and I'm enjoying it quite a bit. But still, didn't do half as much reading as I wanted to.

# Movies

Movies this month are a different story though.

![Letterboxd diary for the month. In viewing order: Princess Mononoke, Aftersun, The Edge of Seventeen, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Ratatouille, Office Space, Heroic Losers (La Odisea de los Giles), Uncut Gems, The Social Network, Moana, Dead Poets Society](../../assets/images/2024-12-03-november-2024/movies.png)

I watched and rewatched a bunch of great movies this month. Highlights, as always, are:

## Aftersun

MAN. THIS FUCKING MOVIE. GOD FUCKING DAMN. I need to rewatch it one of these days, I feel like there's a lot of things you'd notice on the second rewatch. Really liked it. It's heartwarming but so sad and I don't want to spoil much but I'd recommend everyone to watch it. 

## The Edge of Seventeen

Rewatched this one and it's as great as I remember it being. Funny, witty, emotional, and the relationship between Hailee Steinfeld's and Woody Harrelson's characters is one of my favorites in movies. It's relatable, it's a fun watch, has great casting. Very rewatchable too, I noticed.

## Office Space

This one's a highlight for the wrong reasons. I've heard about this as being a comedy classic, and it has great reviews, but idk... It felt underwhelming to me. It's very funny sometimes but the rest I just felt disappointed... 

## Uncut Gems

I didn't know Adam Sandler could act...

## The Social Network

Honestly think Andrew Garfield is one of the best around, and a personal favorite of mine. He's great in here too. Also I can't believe it took me this long to watch The Social Network.

## Dead Poets Society

And speaking of taking too long to watch... 

THIS MOVIE. I know why it's a classic now. I really need to check more off my Robin Williams watch list. I can't say much that hasn't been said before. Rich gay kids.

# Gaming

This month I mostly played Minecraft, the 2-week phase's been still going strong after a month. I built a good amount of stuff, made a railway, terraformed an entire island to build farms on it, etc. Been a while since I had this much fun with Minecraft.

# This month in retrospect

So, this month I graduated!!! Yay!!!! It's been a fun though busy month, so I couldn't do EVERYTHING I wanted to do. But now I have a lot of free time and I hope I can spend it well.
